We created a maze combat game. The objective is for the player to find their way through the 3 levels to escape from the aliensâ€™ spaceship. On each level the player has different aliens to kill and powerups along the way. To get to the next level the player must collect a key to open a door. When the key is picked up the door opens. The last key will open a door to the players getaway spaceship. To control the player you can use the arrow keys and to shoot the aliens you can use the space bar. If you ever need to pause the game, restart, or exit you can press ESC and see these options on a menu. There is score allocated to the player for killing the aliens so you have the opportunity to be on the leaderboard if you get a top ranked score. Good luck!
To create this game we used resources from our John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt Tutorial for App1, assets from the asset store, and code created during class time. 
Below is the list of game features we created in this app. There are 18 which is about 6 per person.
